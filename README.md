🎮 Gameplay & Logic

🧩 Added X and O selection buttons — players can now choose their side directly using stylish buttons with glowing effects (no more log or text prompt).

🔺 X always starts; if the player chooses O, the AI automatically opens the round.

✨ Both X and O are now fully functional, with smooth animations and color consistency across rounds.

🌟 Dynamic win-line highlight — winning cells flash and glow for extra feedback.

🛡️ Improved input handling — prevents duplicate clicks and blocks player moves during AI’s turn.

🖥️ UI / UX Enhancements

🎨 New Restart button style — now matches “Change Name” and “Color-Blind Mode” buttons for a unified look.

🎨 Automatically injects a “Color-Blind Mode” button beside Restart for quick accessibility toggling.

🌀 Respects reduced-motion preferences — disables animations if the system requests less motion.

🌈 Color-Blind Support & Theming

👁️‍🗨️ Five high-contrast palettes implemented:

🎯 Default – Red / Cyan

🍊 Deuteranopia – Orange / Deep Blue

🧱 Protanopia – Brick / Teal

💜 Tritanopia – Magenta / Green

⚫ Monochrome – Light Gray / Dark Gray

🪄 Color-Blind Mode button cycles through palettes and saves your last choice in localStorage.

🎨 Change Color buttons remain active — they randomize UI accent hues without affecting X/O colors.

🏆 Score & Leaderboard

📊 Existing scoring and fastest-time tracking remain intact.

🧹 Added a 50-entry cap on the leaderboard for performance and storage safety.

✅ Smoother round flow — choose X or O each time before playing.
🌟 Clearer visual feedback when a player or AI wins.
⌨️ Fully keyboard-friendly and screen-reader accessible.
🎨 Color accessibility and theme settings now persist between sessions.
